            <p>Our research group is primarily focused on revolutionizing phage therapy through advanced deep learning approaches. We are working towards developing sophisticated computational models to analyze and predict phage-host interactions in the wet lab, enabling the design of highly targeted phage cocktails against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. By integrating comprehensive datasets on bacterial defense systems, surface variations, and evolutionary dynamics, we aim to create predictive tools that will transform personalized antimicrobial treatments and address the global crisis of antibiotic resistance.</p>
